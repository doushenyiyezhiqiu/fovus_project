Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Node.js and npm: Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install them from Node.js official website.

AWS CLI: Install the AWS CLI and configure it with your AWS account credentials. This is necessary for accessing AWS services. Instructions can be found on the AWS CLI documentation page.

Installation Steps

1. Set Up the CDK Project
Navigate to the cdk-project directory and install the necessary npm packages:

cd path/to/cdk-project
npm install

2. Set Up the Lambda Function
Change to the lambda directory within the CDK project to install dependencies required by the Lambda function:

cd lambda
npm install

3. Deploy with AWS CDK
Return to the cdk-project directory to deploy the project using AWS CDK:

cd ..
cdk deploy
If the CDK is not installed globally, you might need to install it first:

npm install -g aws-cdk

4. Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory to install its dependencies:

cd path/to/frontend
npm install
Run the frontend application:

npm start

This command will open a new page in your default web browser. You can then interact with the application, enter the text, and upload a .txt file.

5. Verify the Deployment
After setting up the frontend, use it to upload a file and input some data. Verify if the deployment is successful by checking the outputs in your AWS account.
